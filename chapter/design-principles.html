                        The challenge is to develop an application that tries
                        to increase the user’s participation in team sports
                        through online communities. Several factors play 
                        into the success of this concept. It is not possible 
                        to achieve this goal if the application is not properly 
                        designed. To achieve this, design principles of several 
                        disciplines are applied to achieve a user-centric
                        solution.

                    <h3><strong>User Experience Design</strong></h3>
                    <p> 
                        The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at Apple (NORMAN, 2013, P. XIII F.). User 
                        experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its services, and its products. The focus and most important goal of 
                        good user experience is to meet the user’s needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required between different disciplines, such as 
                        engineering, marketing, graphic design, industrial design, and interface design <i>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.)</i>.

                    User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the visuals, the haptics, and the audio to how the 
                    product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors: its look, feel, and usability <i>(IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04)</i>.

                <p>
                    User Experience Design requires a solid understanding of the psychology and behavior of the user. Understanding how users perceive a 
                    product allows user experience designers to iterate their concepts and better achieve the user’s goals. According to Marc Hassenzahl and Sarah 
                    Diefenbach’s paper Well-being, Need Fulfillment, an%d Experience Design, any positive experience is based on meeting psychological needs. The 
                    fulfillment of psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation and security, contributes to the well-being of the 
                    user and leads to a pleasant user experience. In experience design, these needs are taken as guidelines and inspiration in the design process 
                    <i>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of these needs have already been discussed in Chapter 2.1, but in the following, they are considered from the perspective of emotion, 
                    while additional needs are addressed.

                As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating people to participate in various activities. 
                Thus, it is also an important factor for participation in sports. Since this thesis addresses the question of how online sports community 
                apps should be designed to increase the user’s participation in team sports, the focus during the design phase is laid especially on 
                relatedness.
                In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”. In addition to the approach of Hassenzahl and Diefenbach, 
                other approaches define user needs for good user experience. Design leader Stephen P. Anderson, for example, developed the 
                “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model (→ FIG. 05). Rather than focusing on the psychological side of the user needs, 
                this model is based on a product’s maturity process. Anderson proposes that products proceed through six stages of maturity, 
                during which they can grow from a purely functional product, to a product that is meaningful to the user <i>(ANDERSON, 2011, P. 10F.)</i>.

                    <h3>Community-Centered Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to interact with each other <i>(PREECES, 2004, P. 3FF)</i>. 
                        According to Preece, developing online communities is different from designing software as software, once shipped, is stable 
                        and does not change until the next update while online communities develop and change through dynamic interactions. 
                        It is first and foremost a social experience that changes according to who is participating, the number of people involved, 
                        and the type of discussion that takes place <i>(IBID., P.4)</i>. For example, the dynamics between new and long-established communities 
                        differ notably. While the software might not change drastically, social interactions will adapt according to the growth of the 
                        community. This social adaption is called “sociability” <i>(IBID.)</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In many online communities, these social changes are at least as influential as software changes. 
                        Therefore, crucial to not only focus on the usability of the design but also on sociability. 
                        Therefore, knowledge from different disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, 
                        as well as user-centered design is required <i>(IBID.)</i>. In participatory community-centered design methodology <i>(→ FIG. 07)</i>, 
                        members of the community are involved in the design process from the beginning. In community-centered design, 
                        six phases are each followed by an evaluation period and iterations based on the findings.

                        The first step involves understanding the community. This means understanding the community’s needs. 
                        It is important to understand who the members of the community are and what the main purpose of the community is. 
                        It is about understanding for whom this community exists and what the participants’ habits are <i>(PREECE, 2004, P. 4)</i>.

                    <dt>Select a Technology Plan for Sociability</dt>
                    <dd>
                        After understanding the potential members of the community, it is important to select the technology for communication 
                        within the community. Suitable mediums, such as timelines, discussion boards, or chat areas, must be discussed and the 
                        software should be tailored to suit the needs of the community <i>(PREECE, 2004, P. 4F.)</i>.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Test Prototype</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Step three requires testing of the prototype with the potential members of the community. 
                        The intended software and sociability structures need to be validated at a basic level. 
                        This validation includes the representation of social policies and social interactions. 
                        For example, if members must complete a registration policy before joining the community, its comprehensibility must be ensured. 
                        In this step, iterative changes are made according to the user feedback <i>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5)</i>.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Test Sociability and Usability</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Step four extends the testing made in step three and focuses on validating the design choices for good user experience 
                        and sociability. The usability, user interface, and the feel of the interaction are tested with the user. 
                        At this stage, substantial emphasis is laid on the overall user experience. <i>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5)</i>.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Nurture the Community</dt>
                    <dd>
                        After establishing the basis for the online community, the final step consists of nurturing the community. 
                        It is the most important process as long as the community exists, since nurturing the community allows new members 
                        to feel welcomed and supported, thus enabling growth. Furthermore, the community must be well advertised, 
                        so that this growth can continue over a long period of time <i>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5F.)</i>.

                    <h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        A design process can be approached in numerous ways. The previously mentioned community-centered design process is 
                        tailored specifically towards online communities and how members interact with each other. The problem, however, is that 
                        factoring in the unanimous behavior of a large group may result in neglect of an individual’s personal experience with the product. 
                        A more personal and empathetic approach is that of human-centered design (HCD).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        HCD factors in the emotional and psychological preferences of the individual. According to Norman, this approach that “puts human needs, 
                        capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving” <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 8)</i>. 
                        HCD puts the individual experience with the product first, considering the whole user experience <i>(IXDF - UCD, N.D.)</i>. 
                        Norman describes HCD as a philosophy that starts with understanding humans and their needs and difficulties through observation. 
                        Since people often do not realize their own needs, it is the designers’ responsibility to observe and define them <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 9)</i>.
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <p>There are four different phases in HCD <i>(→ FIG. 08)</i>.</p>

                            <dd>
                                Observation is the phase in which the user’s situation and the underlying problem that needs to be solved are researched by the designers. 
                                To understand the people for whom the solution is intended, one must observe them in their daily lives to fully understand their environment, 
                                the daily problems they encounter, and their goals. Furthermore, the current market offer is explored to determine how the problem 
                                has been approached by others <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 222F.)</i>.

                                various ideas are accumulated to select the best solution for the given problem. It is important that no idea is discarded or focused on too early, 
                                as creative variety is the essence of ideation <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 226)</i>.

                                After the ideas are prototyped, they become tangible so that they can be tested later. Since feedback is crucial in the early stages of the design process, 
                                prototypes contain only the core functionality of the product with the relevant components that need validation. 
                                Prototypes demonstrate the real product <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 227F.)</i>.

                                Testing the prototypes with real users who correspond closely to the target demographic uncovers weaknesses and strengths of the concept. 
                                Assumptions made up to this point can be confirmed or refuted. Furthermore, the insights gathered throughout this phase are used to shape the subsequent iterations, 
                                thus improving the solution in the process <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 228F.)</i>.

                            These four phases are repeated constantly until the solution fulfills potential. HCD is an iterative process in which each iteration produces more insight, 
                            bringing the solution closer to its goal. The result is a product that resonates more deeply with the target audience <i>(NORMAN, 2013 P. 229F.)</i>. 
                            HCD might also be called user-centered design <i>(W3C - UCD, N.D.)</i>.
