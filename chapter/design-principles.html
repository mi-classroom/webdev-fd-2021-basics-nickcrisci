                        The challenge is to develop an application that tries
                        to increase the user’s participation in team sports
                        through online communities. Several factors play 
                        into the success of this concept. It is not possible 
                        to achieve this goal if the application is not properly 
                        designed. To achieve this, design principles of several 
                        disciplines are applied to achieve a user-centric
                        solution.

                    <h3><strong>User Experience Design</strong></h3>
                    <p> 
                        The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at Apple (NORMAN, 2013, P. XIII F.). User 
                        experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its services, and its products. The focus and most important goal of 
                        good user experience is to meet the user’s needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required between different disciplines, such as 
                        engineering, marketing, graphic design, industrial design, and interface design <i>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.)</i>.

                        noticeable. «

                    User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the visuals, the haptics, and the audio to how the 
                    product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors: its look, feel, and usability <i>(IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04)</i>.

                    User Experience Design requires a solid understanding of the psychology and behavior of the user. Understanding how users perceive a 
                    product allows user experience designers to iterate their concepts and better achieve the user’s goals. According to Marc Hassenzahl and Sarah 
                    Diefenbach’s paper Well-being, Need Fulfillment, an%d Experience Design, any positive experience is based on meeting psychological needs. The 
                    fulfillment of psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation and security, contributes to the well-being of the 
                    user and leads to a pleasant user experience. In experience design, these needs are taken as guidelines and inspiration in the design process 
                    <i>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of these needs have already been discussed in Chapter 2.1, but in the following, they are considered from the perspective of emotion, 
                    while additional needs are addressed.

                        Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable and effective instead of thinking that one is incapable and

                        Relatedness is the feeling of having intimate and personal relationships with the people in the environment, rather than feeling

                        Popularity is the feeling of being respected and influencing others, rather than feeling like a person whose advice and opinion are 
                        ignored <i>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</i>.

                    <dd>
                        Stimulation is the feeling of experiencing much of joy and pleasure instead of feeling bored and understimulated <i>(HASSENZAHL & 
                        DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</i>.

                    <dd>
                        Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one’s own life, rather than feeling uncertain and threatened by 
                        circumstances one cannot control <i>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</i>.

                As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating people to participate in various activities. 
                Thus, it is also an important factor for participation in sports. Since this thesis addresses the question of how online sports community 
                apps should be designed to increase the user’s participation in team sports, the focus during the design phase is laid especially on 
                relatedness.
                In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”. In addition to the approach of Hassenzahl and Diefenbach, 
                other approaches define user needs for good user experience. Design leader Stephen P. Anderson, for example, developed the 
                “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model (→ FIG. 05). Rather than focusing on the psychological side of the user needs, 
                this model is based on a product’s maturity process. Anderson proposes that products proceed through six stages of maturity, 
                during which they can grow from a purely functional product, to a product that is meaningful to the user <i>(ANDERSON, 2011, P. 10F.)</i>.

                    <p>After discussing the design principles necessary for a good user experience, this section elaborates on specific ways to approach the design process.</p>
                </section>

                <h3>Community-Centered Design</h3>
                <p>
                    It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to interact with each other <i>(PREECES, 2004, P. 3FF)</i>. 
                    According to Preece, developing online communities is different from designing software as software, once shipped, is stable 
                    and does not change until the next update while online communities develop and change through dynamic interactions. 
                    It is first and foremost a social experience that changes according to who is participating, the number of people involved, 
                    and the type of discussion that takes place <i>(IBID., P.4)</i>. For example, the dynamics between new and long-established communities 
                    differ notably. While the software might not change drastically, social interactions will adapt according to the growth of the 
                    community. This social adaption is called “sociability” <i>(IBID.)</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In many online communities, these social changes are at least as influential as software changes. 
                    Therefore, crucial to not only focus on the usability of the design but also on sociability. 
                    Therefore, knowledge from different disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, 
                    as well as user-centered design is required <i>(IBID.)</i>. In participatory community-centered design methodology <i>(→ FIG. 07)</i>, 
                    members of the community are involved in the design process from the beginning. In community-centered design, 
                    six phases are each followed by an evaluation period and iterations based on the findings.
