                    The challenge is to develop an application that tries
                    to increase the user’s participation in team sports
                    through online communities. Several factors play
                    into the success of this concept. It is not possible
                    to achieve this goal if the application is not properly
                    designed. To achieve this, design principles of several
                    disciplines are applied to achieve a user-centric
                    solution.

                <h3><strong>User Experience Design</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at
                    Apple (NORMAN, 2013, P. XIII F.). User
                    experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its services, and its
                    products. The focus and most important goal of
                    good user experience is to meet the user’s needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required
                    between different disciplines, such as
                    engineering, marketing, graphic design, industrial design, and interface design <i>(NORMAN &
                        NIELSEN, N.D.)</i>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <figure id="quote">

                    » Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit
                    our needs so well that the design is
                    invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams
                    out its inadequacies, making itself very
                    noticeable. «

                User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the visuals,
                the haptics, and the audio to how the
                product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors: its look, feel, and
                usability <i>(IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04)</i>.

                User Experience Design requires a solid understanding of the psychology and behavior of the user.
                Understanding how users perceive a
                product allows user experience designers to iterate their concepts and better achieve the user’s goals.
                According to Marc Hassenzahl and Sarah
                Diefenbach’s paper Well-being, Need Fulfillment, an%d Experience Design, any positive experience is
                based on meeting psychological needs. The
                fulfillment of psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation and
                security, contributes to the well-being of the
                user and leads to a pleasant user experience. In experience design, these needs are taken as guidelines
                and inspiration in the design process
                <i>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of these needs have already been discussed in Chapter 2.1, but in the following, they are
                considered from the perspective of emotion,
                while additional needs are addressed.

                    Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable and effective instead of

                    circumstances one cannot control <i>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</i>.

            As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating people to participate in
            various activities.
            Thus, it is also an important factor for participation in sports. Since this thesis addresses the question
            of how online sports community
            apps should be designed to increase the user’s participation in team sports, the focus during the design
            phase is laid especially on
            relatedness.
            In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”. In addition to the approach of
            Hassenzahl and Diefenbach,
            other approaches define user needs for good user experience. Design leader Stephen P. Anderson, for example,
            developed the
            “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model (→ FIG. 05). Rather than focusing on the psychological side of
            the user needs,
            this model is based on a product’s maturity process. Anderson proposes that products proceed through six
            stages of maturity,
            during which they can grow from a purely functional product, to a product that is meaningful to the user

                <h3>Community-Centered Design</h3>
                <p>
                    It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to interact with each other
                    <i>(PREECES, 2004, P. 3FF)</i>.
                    According to Preece, developing online communities is different from designing software as software,
                    once shipped, is stable
                    and does not change until the next update while online communities develop and change through
                    dynamic interactions.
                    It is first and foremost a social experience that changes according to who is participating, the
                    number of people involved,
                    and the type of discussion that takes place <i>(IBID., P.4)</i>. For example, the dynamics between
                    new and long-established communities
                    differ notably. While the software might not change drastically, social interactions will adapt
                    according to the growth of the
                    community. This social adaption is called “sociability” <i>(IBID.)</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In many online communities, these social changes are at least as influential as software changes.
                    Therefore, crucial to not only focus on the usability of the design but also on sociability.
                    Therefore, knowledge from different disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology,
                    as well as user-centered design is required <i>(IBID.)</i>. In participatory community-centered
                    design methodology <i>(→ FIG. 07)</i>,
                    members of the community are involved in the design process from the beginning. In
                    community-centered design,
                    six phases are each followed by an evaluation period and iterations based on the findings.

                <dd>
                    The first step involves understanding the community. This means understanding the community’s needs.
                    It is important to understand who the members of the community are and what the main purpose of the
                    community is.
                    It is about understanding for whom this community exists and what the participants’ habits are

                <dd>
                    After understanding the potential members of the community, it is important to select the technology
                    for communication
                    within the community. Suitable mediums, such as timelines, discussion boards, or chat areas, must be
                    discussed and the
                    software should be tailored to suit the needs of the community <i>(PREECE, 2004, P. 4F.)</i>.
                </dd>

                <dt>Test Prototype</dt>
                <dd>
                    Step three requires testing of the prototype with the potential members of the community.
                    The intended software and sociability structures need to be validated at a basic level.
                    This validation includes the representation of social policies and social interactions.
                    For example, if members must complete a registration policy before joining the community, its
                    comprehensibility must be ensured.
                    In this step, iterative changes are made according to the user feedback <i>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5)</i>.
                </dd>

                <dt>Test Sociability and Usability</dt>
                <dd>
                    Step four extends the testing made in step three and focuses on validating the design choices for
                    good user experience
                    and sociability. The usability, user interface, and the feel of the interaction are tested with the
                    user.
                    At this stage, substantial emphasis is laid on the overall user experience. <i>(PREECE, 2004, P.
                        5)</i>.
                </dd>

                <dt>Nurture the Community</dt>
                <dd>
                    After establishing the basis for the online community, the final step consists of nurturing the
                    community.
                    It is the most important process as long as the community exists, since nurturing the community
                    allows new members
                    to feel welcomed and supported, thus enabling growth. Furthermore, the community must be well
                    advertised,
                    so that this growth can continue over a long period of time <i>(PREECE, 2004, P. 5F.)</i>.

                <h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>
                <p>
                    A design process can be approached in numerous ways. The previously mentioned community-centered
                    design process is
                    tailored specifically towards online communities and how members interact with each other. The
                    problem, however, is that
                    factoring in the unanimous behavior of a large group may result in neglect of an individual’s
                    personal experience with the product.
                    A more personal and empathetic approach is that of human-centered design (HCD).
                </p>

                <p>
                    HCD factors in the emotional and psychological preferences of the individual. According to Norman,
                    this approach that “puts human needs,
                    capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of
                    behaving” <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 8)</i>.
                    HCD puts the individual experience with the product first, considering the whole user experience
                    <i>(IXDF - UCD, N.D.)</i>.
                    Norman describes HCD as a philosophy that starts with understanding humans and their needs and
                    difficulties through observation.
                    Since people often do not realize their own needs, it is the designers’ responsibility to observe
                    and define them <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 9)</i>.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <p>There are four different phases in HCD <i>(→ FIG. 08)</i>.</p>

                        <dd>
                            Observation is the phase in which the user’s situation and the underlying problem that needs
                            to be solved are researched by the designers.
                            To understand the people for whom the solution is intended, one must observe them in their
                            daily lives to fully understand their environment,
                            the daily problems they encounter, and their goals. Furthermore, the current market offer is
                            explored to determine how the problem
                            has been approached by others <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 222F.)</i>.

                            Through ideation, potential solutions for the given problem are explored. Based on the
                            insights gained in the research phase,
                            various ideas are accumulated to select the best solution for the given problem. It is
                            important that no idea is discarded or focused on too early,
                            as creative variety is the essence of ideation <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 226)</i>.

                            After the ideas are prototyped, they become tangible so that they can be tested later. Since
                            feedback is crucial in the early stages of the design process,
                            prototypes contain only the core functionality of the product with the relevant components
                            that need validation.

                            uncovers weaknesses and strengths of the concept.
                            Assumptions made up to this point can be confirmed or refuted. Furthermore, the insights
                            gathered throughout this phase are used to shape the subsequent iterations,
                            thus improving the solution in the process <i>(NORMAN, 2013, P. 228F.)</i>.

                        These four phases are repeated constantly until the solution fulfills potential. HCD is an
                        iterative process in which each iteration produces more insight,
                        bringing the solution closer to its goal. The result is a product that resonates more deeply
                        with the target audience <i>(NORMAN, 2013 P. 229F.)</i>.
                        HCD might also be called user-centered design <i>(W3C - UCD, N.D.)</i>.

                    Design thinking is a process that, similarly to HCD, is centered on the user.
                    The difference, however, lies in its end goal. HCD is a creative approach that solves known problems
                    by gaining a deep understanding
                    of and empathy for the target demographic <i>(IDEO, N.D.)</i>. According to Michael Burmester, the
                    ultimate goal of HCD is to ensure
                    high usability and good user experience with digital interfaces <i>(BURMESTER, 2016)</i>. Design
                    thinking, on the other hand,
                    is a more general approach to innovation that is not restricted to digital products. It, thus, has a
                    far wider range of application.
                    According to IDEO, the end goal of design thinking is the creation of innovative products that allow
                    “people [to] find the sweet spot
                    of feasibility, viability and desirability while considering the real needs and desires of people”
                    <i>(IDEO, N.D.)</i>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similar to HCD, design thinking is not to be seen as a process or system that must be followed in a
                    certain way but rather
                    as a philosophy or mindset for how to approach human issues <i>(AJ&SMART, 2018)</i>.
                    According to the Hasso-Plattner-Institute of Design at Stanford (d.school), design thinking can be
                    divided into five phases:
                    empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test <i>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.) (→ FIG. 08)</i>.
                </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Empathize</dt>
                    <dd>
                        For the design thinking process, it is first important to gain an empathic understanding of the
                        user and the problem
                        that needs to be solved. Therefore, it is crucial to research the users to really understand
                        their needs, their objectives,
                        their thoughts, their emotions, and their struggles. This can be achieved by observing the user,
                        engaging with the user,
                        or a combination of both <i>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.)</i>.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Define</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The second stage is dedicated to defining the problem. This is accomplished by compiling
                        information gained throughout
                        the empathizing phase. This widespread information is then analyzed and synthesized to define
                        the core problems of the user.
                        Defining the problem through a problem statement will help during the design process to address
                        the relevant problems at any
                        given time without losing focus or straying from the main objective. Defining the problem is
                        about bringing clarity
                        and focus to the design process <i>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.)</i>.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Ideate</dt>
                    <dd>
                        After gaining a solid understanding of the users and their problems, potential ideas for the
                        identified problems are explored.
                        Ideation is about pushing for the widest possible range of ideas to select the best solution for
                        the given problem <i>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.)</i>.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Prototype</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Prototyping involves experimentation and turning ideas into tangible products. A prototype is a
                        scaled-down version of a product that
                        incorporates the potential solutions identified in the previous stages. Prototypes are created
                        to communicate ideas to users <i>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.)</i>.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Test</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Testing the prototypes allows the designers to gain valuable feedback from real users.
                        It is also another opportunity to understand the user, but unlike the initial empathize phase,
                        the insights gained from the
                        preceding phases facilitate a deeper and more realistic understanding of the user. This newfound
                        empathy and knowledge can be used
                        in subsequent iterations to refine a product to its maximum potential <i>(D.SCHOOL, N.D.)</i>.

                <p>
                    For the concept of this thesis, design thinking will be applied to find a creative solution on how
                    to support the user’s participation
                    in team sports. Based on that solution, HCD will guide the design process to ensure high-quality
                    user experience and usability.
                    Furthermore, the principles of community-centered design will be used to emphasize sociability
                    throughout the concept.
